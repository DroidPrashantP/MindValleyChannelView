========================================================================

We would be expecting a README file for the project with the following
questions answered:
- What parts of the test did you find challenging and why?
   Honestly, I've already implemented same kind of featured UI or screen in my work experience so i would say that the challenging level for me is moderate.
   But in general I will say that the tricky parts of the test is to handle the nested UI.

- What feature would you like to add in the future to improve the project?
  In future, I would like to add the following features
  - Like/unlike any content or add to favourites or add rating to content
  - Show the detail view of the New episode, course and series
  - If there was any video content then we can the inline video player
